        User experience case study that dives into perspectives & behaviors surrounding forms of micro-transportation
        and alternatives (such as walking), and proposes a new, adventureous, method of wayfinding to change
        mindsets.<br><br>
        <b>MY ROLE</b><br>
        My partner and I took <b>equal roles</b> defining the project scope and managing our timeline. We both
        contributed towards rounds of user interviews and secondary research. From there, we empathized with these
        user-expressed concerns via personas, and brainstormed solutions to our problem statement. Finally, we
        prototyped our solution by designing a functioning user interface with clean and friendly visual elements. <b>I
          took the lead on building out and prototyping interfaces</b> while my partner designed all 3D assets.

        <p class="boxbottom"><b>Micro-transportation (ways of commuting across short distances, around 5 miles or less)

          Services like Uber and Lyft are expensive even across short distances, and their reliability varies
          significantly with time and location. Similarly, scooter-share and bike-share programs are unaffordable and
          unreliable, on top of being subject to theft and vandalism <a class="extlink"

        <h3 class="boxbottom">USER<br>RESEARCH.</h3>
        <p>
          Our users include people who use micro-transportation in metropolitan/urban/suburban areas.<br><br>
          With this audience in mind, we interviewed 10 individuals who reside in urban & suburban areas to better
          understand their transportation habits and preferences. Then we synthesized our findings into 7 considerations
          that users made when evaluating their commute. These concerns fell into the 2 categories of Availability
          (people CAN use it) vs. Enjoyability (people WANT to use it).
        </p>
        <img class="fullpic boxbottom popup" src="img/portfolio/leaflet/03.png" loading="lazy">
        <p class="boxtop">To obtain quantitative data on availability and enjoyability, we surveyed 43 individuals on
          how they viewed 6 different forms of transportation. We then plotted this data and found that <i>no form was
            both more enjoyable and more available than the others.</i><br><br>
          <b>To solve our issue, we wanted to focus on the form that has the greatest potential to be improved.</b> We
          don’t have direct control over availability; instead, can we increase the enjoyability of the form of
          transportation already most accessible?
        </p>
        <img class="fullpic boxbottom popup" src="img/portfolio/leaflet/04.png" loading="lazy">
        <p class="boxtop">After analyzing results from our survey, it seemed walking was the most available. <i>However,
            people generally don’t enjoy it; why?</i> To get more insights, we interviewed 6 individuals to better
          understand their perception of walking.
        </p>
        <img class="fullpic boxbottom popup" src="img/portfolio/leaflet/05.png" loading="lazy">
        <p>The interviews confirmed that the primary concerns with walking were centered around enjoyability. With this
          in mind, we decided to narrow the scope of the problem we’re trying to solve:</p>
        <img class="fullpic boxbottom popup" src="img/portfolio/leaflet/06.png" loading="lazy">

        <h3 class="boxtop boxbottom">EMPATHY<br>MAP.</h3>
        <p>
          To address this multi-layered issue, we wanted to account for different lifestyles and the varied reasons
          people do not enjoy walking. While exploring these nuances, we created three personas based on our interviewed
          users, illustrating their wants and needs through empathy maps.
        </p>
        <img class="smallpic boxbottom popup" src="img/portfolio/leaflet/07.png" loading="lazy">

        <img class="smallpic boxbottom popup" src="img/portfolio/leaflet/09.png" loading="lazy">

        <h3 class="boxtop boxbottom">AFFINITY<br>MAP.</h3>
        <p>
          We were ready to begin ideating with the specific needs of our personas in mind. To address the major dislikes
          reported in our interviews, we wrote down potential solutions to these 5 major pain points in a 10-minute
          brainstorm.
        </p>
        <img class="fullpic boxbottom popup" src="img/portfolio/leaflet/10.png" loading="lazy">
        <p>To reemphasize: <b>based on our research, walking is already cost-efficient, reliable, and customizable, but
            it is not as enjoyable as it could be.</b><br><br>
          From our affinity map, we focused on the most important features to make an app that increases fun through
          social community exploration and improves comfort through easy resource access and customizable paths.
        </p>

        <h3 class="boxtop boxbottom">WIREFRAME.</h3>
        <p>
          We created a wireframe of the important functionalities (social, community, resource access, custom paths) to
          map out the flow of our app:

        <h3 class="boxtop boxbottom">NEXT<br>STEPS.</h3>
        <p>
          With this prototype in hand, we were near completion; however, to understand areas for future improvement,
          <b>we conducted some usability tests via UserTesting.com.</b> The participants interacted with the core
          functions: Find, Community, Wander, and Friends, and recorded their thoughts and feelings throughout the
          process.<br><br>
          Users felt that the overall application had good purpose and stated that they, or someone they know, would
          enjoy using it. They also enjoyed the friendly and clean visual design, but they felt that certain icons (e.g.
          community) were vague and unclear. Additionally, users felt that the design was too simplistic and they
          desired more information to be displayed, such as incline.<br><br>
          If given more time to develop the prototype, we’d address these users’ concerns, balancing the amount of
          information shown with ease of use. In terms of other features to add to the application, <b>we would also
            like to integrate safety features.</b> Because of the serious nature of keeping walkers safe, though,
          tackling this challenge was not something we had time for in our initial run of this project.<br><br>
